# PCA-and-CA-project
This repository contains source codes and results of PCA and CA conducted on environmental datasets in Northeastern South Africa
The datasets contain environmental data collected from a Nature Reserve in Southern Africa.
We conducted a botanical survey and surface soil samples to analyze the relationship between modern pollen assembalages recovered from the surface samples and the vegetation cover during the botanical survey.
Correspondence Analysis (CA) was carried out to examine the general pattern in the modern pollen assemblages and vegetation data as well as to explore the significance of the variations in both datasets (i.e., if vegetation types are distinguished by the modern pollen assemblage) 
Principal Component Analaysis (PCA) was used to isolate specfic environmnetal variables characteristic of each vegetation type.
